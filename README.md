# T-SHAPE_data

Common notes:

* Tabs with “averaged” in their name present averaged values each biological replicate (“Reactivity” and “STDev” columns) of 3 technical replicates. The averaged value of biological replicates are lanes identified with “Average” and “STDev”. 

* Tabs with “reNorm” in their name present the values after re-normalization (as explain in the Method section). 

* ∆Reactivity values are presented in separate tabs, for both “averaged” and “reNorm” datasets.

Short description of each tab:

**TS#1&TS#2-Cnt**: contains data for unbound experiments for TS#1 and TS#2 for m_SIRT1_ sequence. 

**PK-Cnt**: contains data for unbound mSIRT1 scaffold (TS#2) with and without proteinase K (PK) digestion steps. +PK means with additional PK digestion. 

**DMSOvsddH2O-Cnt**: contains data for checking the effect of DMSO/ddH2O in no-modifier (cnt) experiments. Biological replicates are shown separately – data from processing with cnt+DMSO and cnt+ddH2O are shown in top and bottom, respectively. 

**miR-titration-Cnt**:contains data of different titrations (1:1 and 1:2) betweeen _miR-34a_ (here as the second RNA component) and trans-scaffold. 

**mSIRT1-averaged**: presents averaged value of biological replicates for mSIRT1 sequence (trans-scaffold)

**mSIRT1-averaged-dReactivity**: presents ∆Reactivity values, calculated from averaged values. The covariance values, used for calculating standard deviation (STDev) are shown, as well.

**mSIRT1-reNorm**: presents the renormalized value (as explained in the Method section). The averaged value of buffer nucleotides, for each experimental condition are shown in the same lane. 

**mSIRT1-reNorm-dReactivity**: presents ∆Reactivity values, calculated from renormalized values. 

**miR-34a-averaged**: presents averaged value of biological replicates for miR-34a sequence (trans-scaffold)

**mSIRT1-CisScaffold**: presents the averaged values of 3 biological replicates of mSIRT1:miR-34a complex from cis-scaffold. The reactivity values for mSIRT1 and miR-34a are respectively shown at the top and bottom.

**scrm-averaged**: presents averaged value of biological replicates for scrambled (scrm) sequence (trans-scaffold)

**scrm-averaged-dReactivity**: presents ∆Reactivity values, calculated from averaged values. The covariance values, used for calculating standard deviation (STDev) are shown, as well.

**scrm-reNorm**: presents the renormalized value (as explained in the Method section). The averaged value of buffer nucleotides, for each experimental condition are shown in the same lane. 

**scrm-reNorm-dReactivity**: presents ∆Reactivity values, calculated from renormalized values. 
**scrm-seed-averaged**: presents averaged value of biological replicates for scrambled-seed (scrm-seed) sequence (trans-scaffold)
**scrm-seed-averaged-dReactivity**: presents ∆Reactivity values, calculated from averaged values. The covariance values, used for calculating standard deviation (STDev) are shown, as well.

**scrm-seed-reNorm**: presents the renormalized value (as explained in the Method section). The averaged value of buffer nucleotides, for each experimental condition are shown in the same lane. 

**scrm-seed-reNorm-dReactivity**: presents ∆Reactivity values, calculated from renormalized values. 

**scrm-seed-CisScaffold**: presents the averaged values of 3 biological replicates of scrm-seed:miR-34a complex from cis-scaffold. The reactivity values for scrm-seed and miR-34a are respectively shown at the top and bottom.
